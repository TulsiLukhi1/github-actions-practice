echo "MY_SECRET_VAR=${{ secrets.MY_SECRET_VAR }}" >> $GITHUB_ENV

so we are accessing the secret variable which we set in githuba
and this line store that value in $GITHUB_ENV
so in subsequent step we can use value if needed

This line writes the secret value MY_SECRET_VAR (which you have stored in GitHub Secrets) into the $GITHUB_ENV file. This will make the environment variable MY_SECRET_VAR available to all subsequent steps in the same job.

The $GITHUB_ENV file is a special file used by GitHub Actions to persist environment variables between steps within the same job. By appending variables to this file, you ensure that they are accessible later on in the workflow, without needing to pass them manually from step to step.

✅To summarize:

1. $GITHUB_ENV is a way to define environment variables that can be used in subsequent steps within a GitHub Actions job.

2. Variables defined here are available to all steps that run after this file is updated, making it convenient to handle sensitive data (like secrets) throughout your workflow.



🤔 now quesion is why we store value in other value when we can directly access like secrets.MY_SECRET_VAR

when you can directly access secrets in subsequent steps using ${{ secrets.MY_SECRET_VAR }}. 
So then why bother writing them into $GITHUB_ENV? Here's the difference:

✅ Direct Use of Secrets (${{ secrets.MY_SECRET_VAR }})
When to use:

You only need the secret in a single step, like running a script or passing it to a command.

- name: Use secret directly
  run: echo "Secret is ${{ secrets.MY_SECRET_VAR }}"

✅ Setting via $GITHUB_ENV
When to use:

You want to re-use the value in multiple subsequent steps as a standard environment variable.
You're using tools or scripts that expect values to be in environment variables (e.g., dotenv, or CLI tools that read from env vars like AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID).
You want to avoid writing ${{ secrets.X }} repeatedly and instead rely on $MY_SECRET_VAR.

- name: Set env var
  run: echo "MY_SECRET_VAR=${{ secrets.MY_SECRET_VAR }}" >> $GITHUB_ENV

- name: Use it in another step
  run: echo "Now I can use $MY_SECRET_VAR"

⭕Bonus Tip – Don't do this:
run: echo "MY_SECRET_VAR=${{ secrets.MY_SECRET_VAR }}"
This prints your secret to the logs, which is a security risk unless the run step is marked with ::add-mask:: or the secret is handled securely.

so below is some ways you can avoid it.

✅ 1. Use ::add-mask:: to hide the value
Before echoing a value that may contain secrets, you can mask it like this:

- name: Mask secret before printing
  run: |
    echo "::add-mask::${{ secrets.MY_SECRET_VAR }}"
    echo "Secret value is ${{ secrets.MY_SECRET_VAR }}"  # This will be masked in logs
💡 After masking, the actual value is replaced by *** in the logs, even if it appears in echo commands.

✅ 2. Avoid echoing secrets at all
This is very obious
If you don’t really need to see the value, just don’t echo it:

- name: Use secret safely
  run: |
    # Using secret without printing it
    some-command --token "${{ secrets.MY_SECRET_VAR }}"


Now, something important which most of the time is overlooked !

GitHub provides two main scopes for secrets:

🔐 1. Repository Secrets
Scope: Available only within a single repository

Where to find:
Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Repository secrets

Use case: Most common. Perfect for secrets used only by this repo (e.g., API keys, tokens, or credentials needed for that project).

🔐 2. Environment Secrets
Scope: Tied to a specific environment within your repo (like production, staging, dev)

Where to find:
Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Environment secrets

Use case: Useful when you want to:

Separate secrets based on deployment environments

Add manual approvals or deployment rules (like branch protection) before running workflows

Improve security by limiting access to certain secrets

🆚 Key Differences
Feature	        Repository Secret	    Environment Secret
Scope	        Whole repo	            Specific environment
Access Control	Basic	                Fine-grained (e.g. branch, manual approval)
Security	    Less control	        More control
Use Case	    General workflows	    Deployments or sensitive actions

here we will use repository secret as we dont have any environment and right now no need for that complexity


Now RESULT,

in result you will not be able to secret values and it will show ***
why this happens?
Run echo "Setting up environment variables..."
  echo "Setting up environment variables..."
  echo "MY_SECRET_VAR=***" >> $GITHUB_ENV
  echo "MY_OTHER_SECRET_VAR=***" >> $GITHUB_ENV
  shell: /usr/bin/bash -e {0}
Setting up environment variables...
0s
Run echo "Using environment variables..."
Using environment variables...
MY_SECRET_VAR is set to ***
MY_OTHER_SECRET_VAR is set to ***
Above variable are displayed using the variable we set using /home/runner/work/_temp/_runner_file_commands/set_env_76c8a429-8eda-4113-89a5-55c78d677a4f


this is output of workflow for reference

so, here's the case , GITHUB mask that for us!
woww! he know that is is sercet because we use secret.* 
and it will not show variable set using $GITHUB_ENV because github knows there also that is is env variable set so it mask it for security.

🧠 This is by design for safety:
GitHub automatically masks all secrets in logs to prevent accidental leakage — even if you didn’t use ::add-mask::

Thank you GITHUB ! You are awesome! 😉
