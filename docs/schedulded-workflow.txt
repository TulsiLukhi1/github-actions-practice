now , first time when i saw dummu example of this which was 

name: Scheduled Job

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 8 * * *'  # Every day at 8 AM UTC

jobs:
  run-scheduled-task:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Print date and message
        run: |
          echo "Running daily scheduled task at $(date)"


so it is simple that after particular time we print something

🕓 How cron Works
* -->  Any value
0 8 * * *  -->   8 AM UTC Daily	
*/15 * * * * --> 	Every 15 mins	

GitHub uses UTC time, so if you want 1 PM IST, convert it to 7:30 AM UTC.

✅ To Test It:
You can't manually trigger this (unless you add workflow_dispatch).
So push this file and wait for the next scheduled time.


now i want sommething real right as why we even need scheduled thing in our dev projects
so here's real world use case
you want to do back up daily at 8am , so what you will do , make backup by yourself , no right?
 

so we can schedule the backup , so i have added code in file

so it creates backup folder with data and attach file and add text into it
mkdir -p backup/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)
echo "Backup is taken on $(date)" > backup/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)/info.txt
Backup is taken on $(date)" this will be written into info.txt file of that date

so i was like how i can access that backup folder right?
I want to see that backup is taken or not !

here is answer what happen and what we can do to see that folder in our case!😉

whatever we run in github actions 
It runs inside a virtual machine (called a runner) that GitHub temporarily spins up to execute our workflow.
🔧 So it's not your local machine, and not directly in GitHub’s UI either — it's a clean virtual environment (like a mini Linux/Windows computer) created for each run.

🧹 And after the job finishes?
That virtual machine is destroyed.
So anything you created (like folders, files) will be gone unless you:

Upload them as artifacts ✅
Or commit them to a repo (not ideal for temp files)
☁️ Upload to cloud (e.g., S3, GDrive, etc.)


okay we can not ccommit to repo that is absolutely right
becase we are taking bacckup everyday and our repo should not have that

so what we can do is create artifacts...

again new word!🤔

so what is this artifacts???

An artifact is any file or folder your workflow creates that you want to keep after the job finishes.

Think of it like: 
🧳 A suitcase where you pack up the output (logs, build files, backups, test reports, etc.) from the runner, so you can download it later.

🔍 Why Use Artifacts?
Save build outputs (like compiled code, zipped apps)
Save test results
Store logs or backup files
Share files between jobs in the same workflow

📦 How to See Artifacts?
After the job runs:

Go to the repo → Actions tab
Click your workflow run
You’ll see a "Download artifact" button with the name (like daily-backup)
