So first i got this error
arserError: D:\a\_temp\ba8ef931-1d9f-4199-b7b4-f7d7fb07e507.ps1:3
Line |
   3 |  for %%f in (scripts\*.bat) do (
     |     ~
     | Missing opening '(' after keyword 'for'.


this error comes from a PowerShell context interpreting batch script syntax, which doesnâ€™t work directly in a run: block on Windows runners, 
because GitHub Actions uses PowerShell by default on Windows.

In short:

Your run: step on Windows runs in PowerShell.

But you're writing a batch script loop, which causes a parser error.

so there is two option 

1. we change syntax to of for loop according to PowerShell script (preffered)
- name: Run Windows Batch Scripts
  if: runner.os == 'Windows'
  run: |
    Get-ChildItem -Path scripts\*.bat | ForEach-Object {
      Write-Output "Running $_ ..."
      & $_.FullName
    }

2. forcefully tell github actions to use cmd
- name: Run Windows Batch Scripts (CMD shell)
  if: runner.os == 'Windows'
  shell: cmd
  run: |
    for %%f in (scripts\*.bat) do (
      echo Running %%f ...
      call %%f
    )


âœ… Why PowerShell is preferred over CMD in GitHub Actions (Windows)
Default Shell â€“ PowerShell is the default on Windows runners (no need to override shell:).

Modern & Powerful â€“ Supports objects, better error handling, and scripting features.

No Syntax Errors â€“ CMD-style loops (like for %%f) fail in PowerShell unless you switch shells.

Better Integration â€“ Cleaner logs, easier use of GitHub Actions variables and outputs.

Future-Ready â€“ PowerShell is actively maintained; CMD is legacy.

ðŸ‘‰ Use CMD only if working with legacy .bat scripts , scripts which can not be easily converted in PowerShell script
