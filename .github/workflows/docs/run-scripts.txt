So first i got this error
arserError: D:\a\_temp\ba8ef931-1d9f-4199-b7b4-f7d7fb07e507.ps1:3
Line |
   3 |  for %%f in (scripts\*.bat) do (
     |     ~
     | Missing opening '(' after keyword 'for'.


this error comes from a PowerShell context interpreting batch script syntax, which doesnâ€™t work directly in a run: block on Windows runners, 
because GitHub Actions uses PowerShell by default on Windows.

In short:

Your run: step on Windows runs in PowerShell.

But you're writing a batch script loop, which causes a parser error.

so there is two option 

1. we change syntax to of for loop according to PowerShell script (preffered)
- name: Run Windows Batch Scripts
  if: runner.os == 'Windows'
  run: |
    Get-ChildItem -Path scripts\*.bat | ForEach-Object {
      Write-Output "Running $_ ..."
      & $_.FullName
    }

2. forcefully tell github actions to use cmd
- name: Run Windows Batch Scripts (CMD shell)
  if: runner.os == 'Windows'
  shell: cmd
  run: |
    for %%f in (scripts\*.bat) do (
      echo Running %%f ...
      call %%f
    )


âœ… Why PowerShell is preferred over CMD in GitHub Actions (Windows)
Default Shell â€“ PowerShell is the default on Windows runners (no need to override shell:).

Modern & Powerful â€“ Supports objects, better error handling, and scripting features.

No Syntax Errors â€“ CMD-style loops (like for %%f) fail in PowerShell unless you switch shells.

Better Integration â€“ Cleaner logs, easier use of GitHub Actions variables and outputs.

Future-Ready â€“ PowerShell is actively maintained; CMD is legacy.

ðŸ‘‰ Use CMD only if working with legacy .bat scripts , scripts which can not be easily converted in PowerShell script



so again after doing this changes , 
I got same error for python scripts like this

Run echo "Running Linux Python scripts Started"
  echo "Running Linux Python scripts Started"
  chmod +x ./scripts/*.py
  for script in ./scripts/*.py; do
    echo "Running $script..."
    python3 $script
  done
  echo "Running Linux Python scripts Started"
  shell: C:\Program Files\PowerShell\7\pwsh.EXE -command ". '{0}'"
ParserError: D:\a\_temp\c7b3dd38-815d-4483-9fd5-f6b796c22430.ps1:4
Line |
   4 |  for script in ./scripts/*.py; do
     |     ~
     | Missing opening '(' after keyword 'for'.


now as this is shell code , it will not work because of same reason which I explained above
but quesion is if this is the case than it should not work on ubantu also 
but it is working properly so what is issue ?

so here's the thing ubantu or linux system by default uses Bash shell by default, while Windows runners in GitHub Actions use PowerShell by default.

so we have to again write code according to os as we done for .sh and .bat files
